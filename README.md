Tools for astrophysics use

Programs I wrote for use in Astrophysics. 
Solarsystem simulation is a N-body simulation that allows the user to input planet parameters. The simulation will then create a video of the planets orbital behaviors.
This simulation will allow the user to simulate a rouge planet entering our solar system allowing for the exploration of capture parameters.
